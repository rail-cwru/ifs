\subsection { Analyzing Feature Sets Metrics and Comparing Classifiers }
Version A
Computer Science Group 
- 2356 
- 250
- 783
    - used rank loss to compare feature sets. Noted that high rank loss indicates that the current feature set is not consistent with the information provided in the first
    - correctly read Markov blanket pie chart 
    - used ROC curves to compare performance
    - used confusion matrix to see which classifier did better for which classes

Others Group
- 999999 
- 61241 
- 9871  
    Correctly utilized the MB pie chart and feature importance chart to 
    Utilized the metrics to compare classifiers
    Utilized both the confusion matrix and ROC curve to compare the performances of classifiers

\subsection { General Observations }
\subsubsection { Version A }
Computer Science Group 
- 2356 
    - used feature analysis metric to analyze many feature sets before creating a classifier
    
- 250 
    - used all the features on the 7th trial.
    - thought all the features were relevant. Did not remove irrelevant features or thought each feature added a bit more information. May not have thought about optimizing for size of feature set. 
- 783
    - spend more thing analyzing the feature metrics before creating classifiers 

Others Group
- 999999 
    - used the feature analysis metrics to analyze the influence of each feature and a group of features
    - observed and guessed whether a feature is more predictive than another using the metrics
    - participant said that the features that seem more predictive make sense that are predictive
   

- 61241 
    - if the removed features didn’t affect accuracy that much then they left it out in later trials (attempts at removing irrelevant features
    - if a removed feature affected accuracy, then they added back the feature. For example, when they removed scholarship, accuracy decreased a lot, then in future trial they added scholarship back. 
    - initially started off with 8 features including the 4 Markov blanket features
    - usually didn't remove more than 2 features at once. 
    - usually did not remove and add features at the same time.
    
- 783
    stated that some of the features they choose seemed intuitive. 
    stated that for some parts of the process, they relied more on their intuition than on the visuals presented on the page. 
    
\subsubsection{ Version B }
The participants are not provided with additional or prior information about features. The participants started with an empty set and had different methods of selecting features to create classifiers. 

Computer Science Students Group
- 54011 (Brian Guo)
     
    
- 7878 (Ben)
     When participant removed Humidity from selected features, the accuracy dropped significantly. However participant did not add humidity back to the selected feature set. May not have known how to visualize the difference between previous feature sets. The participant selected features that they thought effected student grades to create the first classifier. The participant answered that they thought mother/father has job, family support, family income would effect student grades and used that set of features to create their first classifier. Then added features that they thought would be effected by student grades in the second trial - such as study time, extracurriculars, college, scholarship.

Others Group
- 5419 (Vivian)
    Participant mentioned using previous knowledge about features to select for features
    Participant added features that may be correlated to student grades. 
    Started with a small feature set - two features. Removed and added a new feature to discover if the new feature is predictive. Figured out extra classes is predictive and more predictive than extracurriculars because when they removed extra classes from a selected set with just extracurriculars and study time and added extracurriculars, the accuracy decreased from 0.82 to 0.57. When they added additional features individually to the set with study time and extracurriculars, the accuracy decreased. After a few more trials, they settled on studytime and extracurriculars

Participants using version A tend to spend more time between trials. (Need to record time between trials)

54011 and 64011 mentioned clicking to select features rather than dragging.
